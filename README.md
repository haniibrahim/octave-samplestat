# samplestat - Octave package for sample statistics

Octave package for statistics of normal distributed populations.

This package is made for normal distributed, natural scientific (chemistry, physics) data in the first place. The tests are focused for distributions of less than 30 samples. 

But they are some tests for bigger distributions, like Pearson-Hartley, Grubbs and Chi-squared test.

It contains the fllowing functions:

- Stray area (range of dispersion of the values)
- Trust area (range of dispersion of the mean)
- Outliert tests
  - Dean-Dixon
  - Pearson-Hartley
  - Grubbs
  - Grubbs (2-sided)
  - Nalimov*
- Test for normal distribution
  - Chi-squared*
  - Shapiro-Wilk*
- Graphs
  - Tukey's boxplot*
- Make an Octave package*
